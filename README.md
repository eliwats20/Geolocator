# Geolocator

Web Application that finds the geolocation of IP Addresses

Description: This project serves as a web application that finds the geolocation of IP addresses. It will be provided with a Windows PowerShell backend to use the ipinfo API to find the geolocation details such as the city, state, postal code, country, and more. The website is designed with an interactive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JSON files are created and AJAX is used to allow the client to interact with the API and send requests to fetch information that will be displayed on the front-end.
