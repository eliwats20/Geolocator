Web Application that finds the geolocation of IP Addresses

Description: This project is a comprehensive web application designed to store, receive, and visualize geolocation and additional information associated with IP addresses. It utilizes a Node.js, Express.js, and Windows Powershell backend to use the ip-api API, which contains geolocation details such as the city, state, postal code, country, and more information. The IP address data was generated from Python file in an existing GitHub repository, producing a file with 100 rows of synthetic IP address data. Database management and data handling was implemented through a MariaDB SQL database, which supports data handling. For data visualization. R was used to provide graphs that displayed information on the user interface from the database. The website is designed with an interactive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. AJAX requests is used to send requests to the Node.js server to fetch information that will be displayed on the front-end.
